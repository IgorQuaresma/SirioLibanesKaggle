**INTRODUCTION**

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. [2] The first case in Brazil was reported on February 26 and the country reached community transmission on March 20.

Since the Covid-19 can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, the use of ICUs (Intensive Care Unit) became fundamental for a big amount of patients. Considering that the ICUs are limited, the correct use of these resources can be the difference to save more lives. There is urgency in obtaining accurate that to better predict and prepare healthcare systems and avoid collapse.

This project will explore the dataset of Covid-19 patients provided by  the Hospital Sírio Libanês at kaggle platform.

**DATA INFORMATION**


The columns "ICU" is the one that need to be predicted i

The dataset contains anonymized data from Hospital Sírio-Libanês, São Paulo and Brasilia. All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. Data has been cleaned and scaled by column according to Min Max Scaler to fit between -1 and 1.

The data is divided in different columns, which contain information about:
Patient demographic information (3 columns)
Patient previous grouped diseases (9 columns)
Blood results (36 columns)
Vital signs (6 columns)



**OBJECTIVES**

The project has two main objectives:

Objective 1 - Predict admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases

Objective 2 - Predict NOT admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases

**PROJECT STRUCTURE**


The project is divided in three parts, each one is in one specific notebook, which are shown below:

Bootcamp_PF_PreProcessing - is the notebook used to do the pre-processing analysis. This notebook contains activities such as cleaning the data
handling missing values, and adapting the data format for the next steps of the project.

Bootcamp_PF_ExploratoryAnalysis - is the notebook used to do the exploratory analysis. This notebook contains querys, charts, and other tools to interpret / understand the available data in more detail

Bootcamp_PF_MachineLearningModel - is the notebook used to do the predictions about the tasks given by the  Sírio Libanês Hospital. This notebook contains different ML models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.
